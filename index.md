My name is Jan Pierskalla and I am a Professor of Political Science at the Ohio State University. I study the political economy of state-building, development, and bureacracy.

Together with [Florian Hollenbach](http://fhollenbach.org/), I am also the co-organizer of the [Virtual Workshop in Historical Political Economy](http://historicalpe.org/).

I am also a [2022 GenCon DCC Tournament Champion](https://goodman-games.com/blog/2022/10/08/all-the-tournament-winners-2/)

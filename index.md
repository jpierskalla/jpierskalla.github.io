My name is Jan Pierskalla and I am an Associate Professor of Political Science at the Ohio State University. I study the political economy of state-building, development, and bureacracy.

Together with [Florian Hollenbach](http://fhollenbach.org/), I am also the co-organizer of the [Virtual Workshop in Historical Political Economy](http://historicalpe.org/).
